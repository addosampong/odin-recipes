    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Making perfect homemade lasagna doesn’t have to be tedious. It is as
      simple as combining the cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella, eggs, half
      of the Parmesan, and seasonings, and baking the mixture.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ears corn, husked and cleaned</li>
      <li>2 yellow squash, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook and drain the ground beef, then stir in the spaghetti sauce and
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place corn into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15
        minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the corn is cooling, place squash into a skillet and add water.
        Cook over medium heat until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess
        water from the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut kernels off the cobs. Stir corn, butter, parsley, salt, and pepper
        into squash; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5
        minutes.
